### **7. Our Fair Ownership Policy: A Partnership Approach**

At The Astra Flow, we believe in transparency. This section clearly explains how ownership works in our partnership. Our goal is to provide you with maximum value and service, and this model is designed to do just that.

### **7.1 What You Own (100% Your Assets)**

From day one, you have complete and undisputed ownership of the most important parts of your online presence:

- ✅ **Your Domain Name:** Your `.com` or `.org`address is registered in your name. It is your property to keep, whether you stay with us or not.
- ✅ **All Your Content:** Every word of text, every photo you provide, every video you upload—this is your intellectual property. We are simply the platform displaying it.
- ✅ **Your Brand Assets:** Your logo, brand colours, and all other brand identity materials are exclusively yours.

### **7.2 What We Own (Our Service Platform)**

To provide a secure, fast, and fully-managed service at an affordable monthly price, The Astra Flow retains ownership of the underlying technical infrastructure. This includes:

- ✅ **The Astra Flow Website Platform:** The specific code, proprietary configuration, and design templates used to build your site.
- ✅ **Premium Software Licenses:** We pay for and manage all the premium themes, plugins, and security software that keep your site running smoothly.
- ✅ **Server Configuration:** The custom server environment we've built to ensure your website is optimized for speed and security.

### **7.3 An Analogy: Your Shop in the Accra Mall**

Think of your partnership with us like renting a premium retail shop in the Accra Mall.

- The **Mall Management (The Astra Flow)** provides the physical shop space, the lighting, the air conditioning, security, and ongoing maintenance. You don't have to worry about constructing the building or managing its utilities; you get a world-class space to do business in for a simple monthly rent.
- **Your Business (You)** brings in your unique brand, your sign (your domain), and all your products to sell (your content). These are always yours.
- If you decide to leave the mall, you pack up all your products and take your sign with you. The physical shop unit, however, stays with the mall. Our service works exactly the same way. This model allows you to operate from a prime location without the massive upfront cost of building it yourself.

### **7.4 Why We Use This Model**

This partnership model is the key that unlocks our **"no upfront cost"** promise. Instead of charging a large fee of ₵15,000 - ₵25,000+ for you to own a custom-built website, we give you access to our entire managed platform for a low monthly fee. You get the benefits of a professional, high-performing website while we handle all the complex technical burdens.

### **7.5 Your Option for Full Ownership (The Buyout)**

We believe in flexibility. Should your business grow to a point where you need complete control and want to manage your own hosting, we provide a clear path.

- **Buyout Fee:** For a one-time fee of **₵5,000**, you can purchase full ownership.
- **What You Receive:** We will package and deliver a complete copy of your website files and database, allowing you to move to any hosting provider of your choice. This is our way of ensuring you have ultimate freedom as your business evolves.

- Payment is due by the 1st of the service month.
- Payments more than 7 days late may incur a 5% late fee.
