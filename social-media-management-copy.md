## 7. FAQ QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### FAQ 1
**Q: How quickly will we see results from social media management?**

A: Strategic social media builds momentum over time rather than delivering overnight success. Most clients see meaningful engagement increases within 30-60 days as content rhythm establishes and algorithms recognize consistency. Significant business impact - qualified leads, conversion rate improvements, reduced acquisition costs - typically compounds over 90-180 days as community grows and content library builds. We focus on sustainable growth that scales your business, not viral moments that disappear.

---

### FAQ 2
**Q: What platforms should our business prioritize?**

A: Platform selection depends entirely on where your target audience makes purchasing decisions, not where competitors happen to be active. We conduct audience research to identify where your prospects spend time, what content formats they engage with, and which platforms align with your business model. B2B service businesses often prioritize LinkedIn for decision-maker access. Visual consumer brands might focus on Instagram and TikTok. We recommend starting with 2-3 platforms executed excellently rather than spreading thin across everything.

---

### FAQ 3
**Q: Can't we just handle social media in-house?**

A: Absolutely, if you have dedicated personnel, creative resources, strategic expertise, and time to stay current with constantly evolving platform algorithms and best practices. Most businesses discover that in-house social becomes either inconsistent (when priorities compete) or superficial (when done without strategic depth). Our value comes from specialized expertise, dedicated resources, and proven frameworks that deliver results faster than learning through expensive trial and error.

---

### FAQ 4
**Q: How do you measure ROI from social media?**

A: We connect social efforts directly to business outcomes through multi-touch attribution modeling, conversion tracking, and customer journey analysis. This includes measuring direct revenue from social-sourced customers, reduced acquisition costs compared to other channels, increased customer lifetime value from community engagement, and brand equity growth reflected in search volume and direct traffic increases. Every client receives custom reporting focused on metrics that matter to their specific business model.

---

### FAQ 5
**Q: What makes your approach different from other agencies?**

A: Most agencies treat social as a posting service focused on content volume and follower counts. We architect social as strategic business infrastructure designed to reduce acquisition costs, increase customer value, and build compounding brand equity. Our approach integrates platform expertise with business strategy, connecting every post and campaign to revenue objectives. You work with strategists who understand business growth, not just social media coordinators who schedule content.

---

### FAQ 6
**Q: Do we own the content and audience you build?**

A: Absolutely. You retain full ownership of all created content, account access, and community relationships. We operate as strategic partners managing your assets, not gatekeepers controlling access. If our partnership ever concludes, you maintain complete control of accounts, content libraries, and community connections we've built together. Our goal is creating long-term value for your business, not creating dependency on our services.
