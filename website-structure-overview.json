The key is to guide visitors based on their needs: are they looking for an affordable, all-in-one website product, or do they need a tailored, custom solution?

Here’s how to structure your website to present this clearly.

The Core Philosophy: Two Paths to a Powerful Online Presence
Your brand's message is that you provide the right digital solution for businesses at any stage. You offer a clear, productized path (WaaS) for those who need efficiency and predictability, and a custom, consultative path for those with unique, large-scale needs.

Website Structure Breakdown
1. The Homepage: The Welcome & Guide
Your homepage must immediately show visitors that you have two distinct types of offerings.

Hero Section (Top of the page):

Headline: Use a headline that encompasses both services.

Example: "Powerful Web Solutions, Built for Your Business."

Example: "Your Vision, Online. From All-in-One Packages to Custom Digital Experiences."

The Main Event (The Two Pillars): Right below the headline, create two visually distinct, clickable sections. This is the most important part of the page.

Pillar 1: Website as a Service (WaaS)

Title: All-In-One Website Packages

Description: "Get a stunning, professionally managed website for a simple monthly fee. Includes design, hosting, security, and support. Perfect for businesses that need to get online quickly and affordably."

CTA Button: View WaaS Plans

Pillar 2: Custom Services

Title: Custom Digital Solutions

Description: "For brands with unique goals. We build bespoke web applications and execute digital marketing strategies that deliver scalable results and a high return on investment."

CTA Button: Explore Custom Services

Social Proof Section:

Display a "Trusted By" logo bar featuring your most impressive clients. This builds credibility for both your WaaS and custom service offerings.

2. Main Navigation Bar
Your navigation should be clean and reflect these two paths.

Home

WaaS Plans (A direct link, not a dropdown)

Services (This should be a dropdown menu for your custom work)

Custom Web App Development

Digital Strategy for Brands

SEO & Content Marketing

3. The Dedicated Service Pages
Each path needs its own detailed page tailored to its specific audience.

"WaaS Plans" Page: 📦

Audience: Small to medium-sized business owners, startups, entrepreneurs.

Tone: Simple, transparent, and value-focused.

Content:

A clear pricing table with 2-3 tiers (e.g., Starter, Growth, Pro).

List exactly what's included in each plan (e.g., # of Pages, Hosting, SSL Certificate, Monthly Updates, Support).

A simple "How It Works" graphic (e.g., 1. Pick a Plan -> 2. We Design & Build -> 3. Launch & Support).

A detailed FAQ section to answer common questions ("Do I own the domain?", "What happens if I cancel?").

CTAs: "Get Started Today" or "Choose Your Plan."

"Custom Services" Page(s): konsultasi

Audience: Marketing directors, CTOs, enterprise clients.

Tone: Strategic, expert, and consultative.

Content:

Focus on your process and partnership. Talk about discovery workshops, strategy, and collaboration.

Detail your capabilities in different areas (Web Apps, Digital Marketing, Branding).

Showcase in-depth case studies of your work with big brands. Focus on the problem, your solution, and the results (e.g., "Increased user engagement by 45%").

CTAs: "Schedule a Free Consultation" or "Tell Us About Your Project." These should lead to a contact form or a meeting booking tool.

4. The "Our Work / Portfolio" Page
This page is crucial for proving your expertise. The best implementation is a filterable portfolio.

Filters: Allow users to sort your projects by tags like WaaS Website, Custom Web App, Branding, E-commerce.

Benefit: This lets a potential enterprise client see you're more than just a WaaS provider, while a small business can see beautiful examples that are within their reach. It allows you to be a specialist to everyone.

This structure ensures that every visitor, regardless of their budget or needs, immediately understands what you offer and can find the information relevant to them without any confusion.
