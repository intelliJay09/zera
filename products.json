### **Tier I: THE DIGITAL HQ (90 Days)**

*We build your permanent base of operations.*

1. **Commercial Web Architecture:** A high-performance website built to convert, not just look good.
2. **Search Entity Setup:** We register your business as an authority with Google so you rank for your own name.

### **TIER II: THE GROWTH SYSTEM (180 Days)**

*The Promise: Automate the momentum.*

**1. Lead Acquisition Pipelines**

- **The Deliverable:** We build pages and forms that guide visitors to a single goal—booking a call or buying a product.
- **Why:** A standard "Contact Us" page leaks revenue. A "Pipeline" captures it.

**2. The Lead Capture Engine**

- **The Deliverable:** We connect your website directly to a CRM database. Whether a lead comes from Google, a referral, or a cold email, they are instantly captured, tagged, and sent an automated "Welcome" email.

**3. The Traffic Converter (CRO)**

- **The Deliverable:** We install tracking tools (heatmaps/analytics) to watch how people use your site. We then tweak your headlines, buttons, and layouts to turn more of your *existing* visitors into customers.

### **Tier III: THE MARKET MONOPOLY (365 Days)**

*We turn customers into an asset class that pays you forever.*

1. **The Lifecycle Ecosystem:** We build automated email & SMS flows that resell to your customers automatically.
2. **The "Win-Back" Protocol:** A dedicated system to reactivate "dead" leads and turn them into revenue.
3. **The LTV Strategy:** A year-long campaign calendar designed to maximize the Lifetime Value (LTV) of every client.
