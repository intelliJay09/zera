5. Avoid stop words (a, and, the, of) unless needed for clarity
6. No file extensions (.html, .php)
7. No parameters/session IDs in URLs
8. Trailing slash consistency (choose one: with or without)

**Good URL Examples:**
- ✅ `theastroflow.com/services/web-development`
- ✅ `theastroflow.com/blog/how-to-choose-marketing-agency`
- ✅ `theastroflow.com/portfolio/ecommerce-redesign-case-study`

**Bad URL Examples:**

- ❌ `theastroflow.com/blog/2024/01/15/post-title-with-many-words`
- ❌ `theastroflow.com/Services/Web_Development`

**Next.js Implementation:**
```typescript
// app/services/[slug]/page.tsx
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  return [
    { slug: 'web-development' },

Subject: Thanks for mentioning The Astra Flow!

Hi [Name],

I just came across your article [Article Title] and was thrilled to see you mentioned The Astra Flow!

Thanks so much for the shout-out. I noticed the mention isn't linked – would you mind adding a link to our site (https://theastroflow.com)?

It would help readers learn more about our work.

Thanks again for the mention!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Expected Results:** 3-5 unlinked mentions converted per year

#### Tactic 6: Client & Partner Links

- Link only when highly relevant

**Expected Results:** 10-15 forum/community links per year (slow build)

### 6.2 Link Building Outreach Best Practices

2. **Lead with Value:** Explain how your suggestion helps them (fix broken link, improve resource page, etc.)
3. **Be Concise:** 3-5 short paragraphs maximum
4. **No Mass Emails:** Batch of 10-20 personalized emails per week (not 1000s)
5. **Follow Up Once:** If no response in 7 days, one polite follow-up, then move on
